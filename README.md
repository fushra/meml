# meml

My attempt at creating a basic meml interpreter. Currently just a proof of concept.

To run make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- `node`
- `yarn`

Clone this repo, install the dependencies with the `yarn` command, then run `yarn app [file path]`. There are a limited set of tags set in [here](https://github.com/trickypr/meml/blob/a983774c087372d5529df0ef1ae4d6e89994f82f/src/scanner/Tags.ts#L14).
